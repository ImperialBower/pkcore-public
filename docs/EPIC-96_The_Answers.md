# The Answers

One of the things that you will encounter a lot in your journey as a developer
are people who have all the answers. You're using the wrong language. Your
git branching strategy is weak. Use feature flags and all your problems will
be solved. You don't need to do integration testing if you properly unit test
your code.

Managers love these people. They provide magic beans that wash away all the
flaws that those pesky developers keep adding to their magic dreams of
profitability that they see floating by in the sky. The Germans have a
wonderful term for it: [Luftschlösser](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Luftschloss)...
castles in the sky.

When I was starting out 24 years ago, Java was one of those answers. Luckily
for me, my first gig as a professional programmer was for a company that had a
proven reason for using the technology.

XOOM.com was a place where you could set up your own web page. The thing was,
they offered something that the other places didn't have: a Java chat applet.
This was before Microsoft accidentally revolutionized web development by
creating [Ajax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)) as a way
to bring Outlook to the web. It took the rest of the web a while to figure out
the true power behind the technology.

People forget that at the time Java was seen as a front end web technology.
XOOM was one of the few companies that made this a reality through the
[acquisition of Paralogic](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/1999/06/14/daily15.html)
and their Parachat application.

I remember the day [on Montgomery St.](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mcmxli/@37.7923436,-122.4027037,3a,75y,147.49h,93.4t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sgE8EbEADuogtdYugFXAoZA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x808580f51956531b:0xf2cc9e9b9bc109f5!2sMontgomery+St,+San+Francisco,+CA!3b1!8m2!3d37.7973093!4d-122.4036994!3m4!1s0x8085808a19e2e29f:0x5472cfcef0ed8c9e!8m2!3d37.7921796!4d-122.4025152)
in front of XOOM's headquarters.
[Helmut Hissen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/helmuthissen/) was standing there
and I decided to strike up a conversation with him. He was the CTO of Paralogic.
Him, and his partner [Vijay Vaidyanathan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vvaidy/)
had created the Java applet that turned out to be the secret sauce behind
XOOM's rapid rise as a tech startup.

Turns out, that there are a lot of people who want to have anonymous sex chat
with other people. Sex, has been, and always will be, the single biggest driver
of technological innovation. Companies use sex as a way to quickly build up market
share (see facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, Flicky, etc...) only to become
puritanical as they attempt to morph themselves into legitimacy. In the case of
XOOM, it was when they became the short-lived
[NBCi](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nbci) debacle. One could argue
if it was a pump and dump scheme. When I read about Elon Musk using fake accounts
on Twitter as a way to back out of the deal, I can't help but think that he
must be really stupid to fall for that, if he really believes it. It was said
of XOOM after they were acquired that their numbers were inflated. Turns out
that people don't really want to link their purchasing power to their cravings
for anonymous sex. Who knew?

As we casually started up a conversation, I told Helmut that I was wondering
what to do next. I had never talked to him before. He was someone that was
talked about in hush tones. One of the necromancers behind the amazing XOOM
chat applet.

You will be shocked to know that people with more experience that you are just
people. The ones that put on airs and seem to have all the answers are really
using this as a mark to hide all their insecurities. They know they are as much
imposters as we are.

Helmut was a really nice guy, and he offered up to me the best reason I have ever
heard for using a technology: _you should try Java. It's a lot of fun._

At the time, I could sense that the dot.com boom bubble was about to burst. I
always kept a copy of Charles Mackay's history of bubble economies
[Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraordinary_Popular_Delusions_and_the_Madness_of_Crowds)
on my work bookshelf as an inside joke. You could tell that it was a con by
the wording in the prospectuses for pretty much all the startups floating around
at the time warning investors that they did not see turning a profit in the
foreseeable future. All the promises of future wealth were all bullshit. You
either have rock solid equity that you can sell off before people realize that
you're full of shit, or you're being conned.

I could see that the hype train was ramping up fast around Java, and Helmut was
right, learning Java was a lot of fun. This was before Enterprise Java turned
it into IBM's liturgical nightmare of mindless pomp and circumstance.

I saw Java as a hedge against the coming storm. Turns out it was. Fast forward a
few years, and I was scrambling for a job along with just about every other
developer in the Bay Area, and soon I was flying to Ohio to work for half of
what I was making before, doing web training material for medical professionals
working on hernia operations. _The horror... the horror..._

Helmut showed me the path. The things that you create out of a sense of joy
will always light the way for you. Work is going to be hard... it's going to
suck. You will be struggling against a seemingly constant steam of bs. The vast
majority of it will be people trying to deal with their own fears by displacing
it onto others. _How can I maintain my power within the company? Who do I need
to blame for my team's failures? How can I show people that I am a leader?_

The antidote to this is not letting their shit rub off on you. Find your purpose.
Find your joy. Go towards people and places that see your light and positive
energy not as a threat, but as something that they want to share and build on.
Just because everyone else is a miserable fuck, doesn't mean that you need to
be. Find your joy. Dance with it.

Technology is made up of tools. Different people like different tools. Know
*the imperative* behind your tools, and choose accordingly.
